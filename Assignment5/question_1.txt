1. What is the difference between ++i and i++?
    - ++i is a pre increment operator, which increments i and returns i
    - i++ is a post increment operator, which increments i and returns the old value

2. What do you think would happen if you pass an index beyond the range of the string? Or if you pass a negative index? Try it out.
    - It will return undefined for both the above cases

3. Do you think JSON.stringify would work for arrays as well? What about nested objects? What happens if we pass numbers, strings, undefined, null to JSON.stringify?
    - Yes Json.stringify works for all the above values, it returns json equivalent string of it

4. What happens if you pass a regular/invalid JSON string to JSON.parse? What will happen if such an invalid function runs in the program? Will other parts of the code execute correctly after that?
    - If we pass a regular json then it will return a valid js value
    - If we pass a invalid json then it will throw an exception(SyntaxError) and other parts will not execute correctly
